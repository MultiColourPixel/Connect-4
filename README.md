# Connect-4

This is a sample code project that I ended up doing for a successful interview a while back. I found it a fairly interesting challenge as I had to learn about [bitboards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitboard) as well as figure out how to show the addition of game pieces from the bottom going up (things are usually laid out top to bottom).

The project uses Combine (my second attempt at using it) alongside UIKit and is designed for the iPad form factor. I also used Swift Package Manager in order to integrate the OHHTTPStubs library for testing networking code.

It doesn't have any special visual flourishes as that wasn't the goal of the task.
